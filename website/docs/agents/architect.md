# Architect Agent

**Rule pack (canonical):** `.cursor/rules/eversis-role-architect.mdc`  
**Delegated prompt:** [Plan](../prompts/internal/plan) (via `@eversis-implement` — [Implement](../prompts/public/implement))

The Architect designs technical solutions and implementation plans from approved research, turning requirements into phased, executable work.

## Responsibilities

- Solution architecture: components, interactions, data flow.
- Implementation plans with phases, tasks, Technical Context, and clear definition of done.
- Alignment with requirements, practices, and quality expectations.
- Security and QA considerations at design time.
- Clarifying ambiguities with product/analysis context.

## What it produces

- **Solution architecture** — Components, interactions, data flow.
- **Implementation plan** — Phased tasks and checkpoints.
- **Test strategy** — Automated testing focus (no manual QA scripts).
- **Security considerations** — What implementers must address.
- **Quality assurance** — Standards for the implementation pass.

## Tools (typical)

| Tool | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| **Atlassian** | Gather requirements from Jira issues and Confluence pages |
| **Context7** | Evaluate libraries, verify compatibility, search integration patterns |
| **Figma** | Translate visual requirements into technical specifications  |
| **PDF Reader** | Read and extract content from PDF requirement documents  |
| **Sequential Thinking** | Design complex architectures, evaluate trade-offs, break down features |
| **Terminal** | Run build tools, scripts, and validation commands   |
| **Cursor Agent** | Read, search, and edit workspace files |
| **Todo** | Track task progress with structured checklists |

## Handoffs

After human approval of the plan draft, the [Plan Reviewer](./plan-reviewer) stress-tests the plan via internal [Review Plan](../prompts/internal/review-plan). After verdict `APPROVED`, implementation runs through **`@eversis-implement`** ([Implement](../prompts/public/implement)) and the [Engineering Manager](./engineering-manager), including UI flows via [Implement UI](../prompts/internal/implement-ui) when Figma is in scope.
