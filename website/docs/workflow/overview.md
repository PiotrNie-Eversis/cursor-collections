# Workflow Overview

**Cursor Collections** covers the **full product lifecycle**:

> **Ideate → Implement → Review**

Attach **`@eversis-implement`** (or `/eversis-implement`) for the Implement phase — research and planning run inside that flow. Each phase produces documented artifacts with **human gates** where the prompts require them.

:::tip The relay race
Each phase passes a reviewed deliverable to the next. Workshop materials feed the backlog; the Engineering Manager orchestrates research, planning, and implementation; implementation feeds review.
:::

## The phases

### 1. Ideate

- **Role:** Business Analyst
- **Prompt:** `@eversis-analyze-materials`
- Workshop materials → Jira-ready epics and stories with acceptance criteria.
- **Gates:** Gate 1, Gate 1.5, and Gate 2 before Jira sync — see [Workshop Analysis Flow](./workshop-flow).

### 2. Implement

- **Role:** Engineering Manager (delegates Context Engineer, Architect, implementers)
- **Prompt:** `@eversis-implement` with a Jira ID or task description
- **Flow:** Research → plan (human approval) → code → **Fine** + mandatory QA comment draft.
- **Produces:** `*.research.md`, `*.plan.md`, code changes.

### 3. Review

- **Role:** Code Reviewer
- **Prompt:** `@eversis-review`
- Structured review — PASS / BLOCKER / SUGGESTION.

## Implement → Review

| Step | Attach | What happens |
| ---- | ------ | ------------ |
| Implement | `@eversis-implement` or `/eversis-implement` | Engineering Manager: research → plan → implementation; declares Fine + QA draft |
| Review | `@eversis-review` or `/eversis-review` | Structured code review |

## Human review at every step

:::warning Important
Each step requires your review. Open generated documents, iterate until correct, then approve before proceeding. AI output is always a draft.

## Workflow variants

| Variant | Entry | Use when |
| ------- | ----- | -------- |
| **Standard flow** | `@eversis-implement` → `@eversis-review` | Backend / fullstack delivery |
| **UI + Figma** | `@eversis-implement` + `@eversis-review-ui` loop | Design-driven UI |
| **[Workshop analysis](./workshop-flow)** | `@eversis-analyze-materials` | Workshop → Jira only |
| **[E2E testing](./e2e-flow)** | `@eversis-implement` (E2E tasks in plan) | Playwright coverage |
| **[Business Manager Docs](./business-manager-docs)** | `@eversis-ba-docs-planner` → writer | Word `.docx` release docs |
