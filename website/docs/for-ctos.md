# For CTOs

**Cursor Collections** is an AI product engineering framework for **Cursor** — structured workflows from ideation through implementation, review, and quality gates.

:::brand TL;DR:

- Only 10% of teams see real gains from AI coding tools - the gap is structural, not technological
- Cursor Collections restructures your delivery workflow around AI, rather than adding AI on top of it
- Teams use it to compress context gathering, planning, and review while keeping human judgment in the loop
- Covers the full lifecycle: discovery workshop → structured backlog → implementation → code review
- Runs in **Cursor** (rules, prompts, MCP, Agent Skills) — team licensing per your Cursor plan
- Open source, MIT licence

## The AI productivity gap is real and structural

Gartner found that only **10% of software engineers** see meaningful productivity gains from AI coding assistants. The other 90% are using the same tools and getting inconsistent results.

When engineers use AI ad-hoc the results vary by individual. You get pockets of acceleration alongside unchanged delivery speed, inconsistent code quality, and a team that's learned to trust AI selectively and unpredictably.

**Cursor Collections** is a structured response to this problem. It doesn't replace your existing tools or process. It gives AI a consistent place in your delivery workflow with **defined inputs, expected outputs, and human review at every step**.

---

## What it actually changes

This isn't a prompt library. It's a framework that restructures **how work moves through your team** - from raw workshop transcript to production-ready, reviewed code.

The framework covers three delivery phases:

**Product Ideation**: turning discovery workshops into structured, Jira-ready backlogs. Context gathering that used to take 30–60 minutes takes 3 minutes. Workshop transcripts become fully formed tickets with acceptance criteria, edge cases flagged, and backlog prioritised.

**Development**: implementation guided by agents that understand your codebase, your Figma designs, and your Jira context simultaneously. The context-switching that fragments developer focus is replaced by a structured research-then-plan-then-implement loop.

**Quality**: automated UI verification against Figma specs, security review built into every implementation plan, and E2E test suites generated from acceptance criteria. Quality gates that currently happen late in the cycle move earlier, where they're cheap to fix.

## The numbers: illustrative impact categories

The table below describes **the kinds of improvements teams aim for** with structured, AI-assisted delivery. Actual results depend on your domain, team size, and baseline — treat figures as **illustrative**, not a guarantee or a single named benchmark.

| What changes                      | Example direction (varies by team) |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Average lead time                 | Meaningful reduction when workflow is adopted |
| Context gathering time            | Often 60–80% faster in guided flows            |
| Planning time                     | Often 50–70% faster with structured plans     |
| UI defects reaching QA            | Large reduction when Figma + verification used |
| Design-to-code accuracy           | High when specs and review gates are used     |
| E2E test flakiness                | Often reduced with generated, aligned tests     |
| Onboarding time for new engineers | Often faster with shared rules and skills      |

The lead time row is the headline, but the onboarding row often surprises CTOs most. A shared framework can shrink “how we work here” to something engineers can follow from day one.

## Who uses it and how

The structured nature of the framework makes it approachable at any level.

**Junior and mid-level engineers** get guardrails. The structured workflow prevents the most common failure modes: vague tickets turned into over-engineered implementations, missing edge cases, inconsistent code style. AI suggestions are grounded in actual codebase context, not generic patterns.

**Senior engineers and tech leads** get leverage. Planning and context-gathering compress. Code review becomes structured rather than free-form. The framework handles the scaffolding; judgment stays with the people who have it.

---

## What adoption looks like

The framework is open source and layers on your existing **Cursor** workflow. **There's no separate framework runtime to procure beyond your editor and MCP tools.**

A typical rollout runs in three phases:

- **Install and orient** (day 1) — engineers install the framework, read the workflow overview, run their first agent interaction on a real ticket.
- **First sprint** (week 1–2) — one team runs the full Product Ideation → Development → Quality loop on a real project. Friction points surface and get resolved.
- **Team-wide adoption** (week 3–4) — framework becomes the default way of working. Leads review output quality, calibrate to project standards.

The framework is designed to be self-explanatory for engineers who already use **Cursor** with rules and prompts.

---

## Why this is open source

The problem Cursor Collections addresses is **structural**: teams need repeatable workflows, not one-off magic prompts. The framework is MIT-licensed so you can read it, fork it, and adapt it to your context without a separate vendor relationship.

If you get value, the usual trade is to improve the project (issues, docs, or code) and help the next team adopt it faster.
